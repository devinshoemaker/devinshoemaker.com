By default, Next.js does not come with any linting solution. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is commonly used for linting modern web applications, and is a good companion to Next.js.

## Install ESLint Dependencies

First, we need to install these ESLint dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react

# or

yarn add --dev eslint eslint-plugin-react
```

`eslint` is the CLI and main package responsible for linting your project.

`eslint-plugin-react` is a plugin for ESLint with rules specific to React.

## Generate ESLint Config

ESLint requires a config in the root of the project, which can be easily generated with the CLI.

```
npx eslint --init

# or

yarn run eslint --init
```

This command will prompt you for a series of questions:

- Select `To check syntax and find problems`
- Select `JavaScript modules` as the type of module your project uses
- Select `React` as the type of framework your project uses
- Select whether your project uses TypeScript. Note: if you do not already have TypeScript configured then your linter will fail. However, you can easily set this up later with this guide: [[eslint-typescript]].
- Select `Browser` as the environment where your code will run in
- Select what format you want the ESLint config to be in. I personally prefer JSON.
- If prompted to install dependencies, click `Yes`

You should now have an `.eslintrc.*` file generated at the root of your project.

ESLint can now be used with the following commands:

```
npx eslint pages/*

# or

yarn run pages/*
```

The commands above will only lint the files inside `pages/`, but you can customize this however you see fit. You can also specify multiple directories: `pages/* components/*`

For more information on using the CLI, visit the [official documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface).

## Update ESLint Config for Next.js

If you run ESLint as-is then you'll likely have some linting errors. To fix this, we need to update the ESLint config rules to fit Next.js.

The first thing we need to fix is the warning: `Warning: React version not specified in eslint-plugin-react settings`

To get rid of this, we can add `settings` property at the root of our config:

```
{
    "settings": {
        "react": {
            "version": "detect"
        }
    },
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es2021": true
    },
    "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:react/recommended"
    ],
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        },
        "ecmaVersion": 12,
        "sourceType": "module"
    },
    "plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
    "rules": {
    }
}
```

Open the ESLint config that was generated and edit the `rules` object:

```
{
    "settings": {
        "react": {
            "version": "detect"
        }
    },
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es2021": true
    },
    "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:react/recommended"
    ],
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        },
        "ecmaVersion": 12,
        "sourceType": "module"
    },
    "plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
    "rules": {
        "react/prop-types": "off",
        "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off"
    }
}
```

The `react/prop-types` rule enforces that all components have [`prop-types`](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) defined. While we can use `prop-types` with Next.js, TypeScript is typically preferred.

The `react/react-in-jsx-scope` rule will throw an error if a component files not import React. With React 17, which Next.js now ships with, it is no longer necessary to import React and thus this rule can be disabled.

Finally, we need to update the `env` property to include `node` since Next.js supports Server Side Rendering in Node.

```
{
    "settings": {
        "react": {
            "version": "detect"
        }
    },
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es2021": true,
        "node": true
    },
    "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:react/recommended"
    ],
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        },
        "ecmaVersion": 12,
        "sourceType": "module"
    },
    "plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
    "rules": {
        "react/prop-types": "off",
        "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off"
    }
}
```

## Ignore Unnecessary Files

Now that we have ESLint working properly with Next.js, we need to add a file to tell ESLint to ignore certain files that we do not want linted.

Create a file called `.eslintignore` at the root of your project with these contents:

```
**/node_modules/*
**/out/*
**/.next/*
```

## Add Lint Script to package.json

The `scripts` property in your `package.json` can be updated to add a `lint` script to make linting easier:

```
{
  "name": "my-site",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint ./ --ext js,jsx,ts,tsx"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "10.0.5",
    "react": "17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "17.0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.18.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.22.0"
  }
}
```

In this `lint` script we are calling the ESLint CLI, telling it to lint files under the current folder (`./`), and looking for files with the extensions `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, or `tsx`.
